Push-To-Github and Run LaravelShift.com Helper Script

# Background

LaravelShift.com is a great service. Unfortunately it does not allow to connect directly to own GitLab instances.

Repositories must be on GitHub, BitBucket or public GitLab.

# What it does

Push your repository to a on-the-fly created private GitHub repository. Instruct you to run LaravelShift.com.

# Alternatives

You can also use dockerized shifts.
